# SecureManage -  Educational Platform for Online Learning
This website is included as a website where students can gain knowledge through various courses in management. Instructors can manage and add students to share their knowledge and explore the knowledge space of everyday things that was built for the Distributed Systems (DS) module in the second semester of the third year of university and identify the vulnerabilities of the site and improve them. This Repository has been built for the Secure Software Development (SSD) module of the first semester of the fourth year of BSc. in IT degree specialized in Software Engineering program at SLIIT.

<h2>SSD Assignment</h2>
<p>Complete back-end and front-end implementation of Manage, a website where users can log in as students or instructors. Students can view all courses offered by instructors and enroll in the course themselves and pay through Stripe. Some vulnerabilities in the old project we had built were identified using tools like OWASP ZAP, SonarQub and Postman, and then we fixed them and updated them again. 
<p>The architecture behind Manage is the Microservices architecture which is an architecture that is consisted of small services. All the requests between the client side and the server side is done through the API gateway. Our system has 4 specific microservices,
  <ul>
  <li>User Management System</li>
  <li>Course Management System</li>
  <li>Enrollment Management System</li>
  <li>Payment Management System</li>
</ul>
